# Rotex TriggerBot


## Introduction

Rotex TriggerBot is an advanced Valorant triggerbot developed in Python. This triggerbot makes use of colors, such as red, purple, and yellow, to detect targets on the screen and automatically fire when the crosshair is over them. The bot enhances aiming precision and reaction time, improving your gameplay experience in Valorant.
